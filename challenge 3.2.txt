Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the lists based on their CGPA (cumlative grade point average)in descending order.Each student object haas the following attributes:name(string),roll_number(string),and cgpa(float).
test the function with different input lists of students.

# Solution:
def sort_students(students):
    """class student:
  def__init__(self,name,roll_number,cgpa):
  self.name = name
self.roll_number = roll_number
self.cgpa = cgpa
  def sort_students(student_list):
  #sort the list of students in descending order of CGPA
sorted_students=sorted(student_list,key=lambda student:
                       student.cgpa,
                       reverse= true)
#syntax_ lambda arg: exp
return sorted_ students
#example usage:
students=[
  student("hari","A123",7.8),
  student("srikanth","A124",8.9),
  student("saumya","A125",9.1),
  student("Mahindhar","A126",9.9),
]
sorted_students= sort_students(students)
#print the sorted list of students for student in sorted_ students:
print("name:{},roll number:{},CGPA:{}".
      format(student.name,
             student.roll_number,
             student.cgpa))
